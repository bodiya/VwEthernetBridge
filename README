This sketch allows you to forward data from a wireless sensor to the
internet via the Ethernet Shield on the Arduino Uno. This concept is
the basis for more interesting activities like the Home Sensors project.

A simple transmitter (for use with a Digispark) is also included.

I recommend using netcat to test things out before attempting to write any
code to receive data from the Uno.

A modified copy of the VirtualWire library is included, which allows it to
be used at the same time as the Ethernet Shield for the Uno. You can see the
changes that were applied by looking at the latest diff in the VirtualWire.cpp
file. To download the latest (unmodified) version of VirtualWire, go to:
